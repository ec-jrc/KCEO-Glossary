# Introduction

The KCEO Glossary of Terms and Definitions serves as a reference for everyone involved in Earth Observation. We cover a wide range of terms, concepts, and definitions relevant to various EO disciplines such as remote sensing, satellite imagery, geospatial analysis, climate adaptation, and more. We strive to consolidate definitions where appropriate, while also acknowledging the necessity of their plurality when needed. Unlike many other online glossaries, our aim is to build an interactive and participative glossary for the EO community. As a living document, the KCEO Glossary of Terms and Definitions is in a constant state of evolution, continuously adapting while enabling full traceability.
